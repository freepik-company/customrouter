# ExternalProcessorAttachment automatically generates EnvoyFilters to attach
# an external processor (ext_proc) to Istio Gateway workloads.
#
# When this resource is created, the controller generates two EnvoyFilters:
#   1. <name>-extproc: Inserts the ext_proc filter into the HTTP filter chain
#   2. <name>-routes: Injects a route that uses cluster_header for dynamic routing
#
# Optionally, a third EnvoyFilter (<name>-catchall) can be generated to create
# catch-all virtual hosts for specified hostnames, allowing CustomHTTPRoutes to
# handle requests without requiring a base HTTPRoute.
#
# The external processor sets the header 'x-customrouter-cluster' with the target
# cluster name, and the injected route uses this header to route traffic dynamically.

spec:
  # gatewayRef specifies which Gateway workloads to attach the external processor to

  # catchAllRoute (optional) configures automatic generation of catch-all routes.
  # When specified, the controller generates an EnvoyFilter that creates default
  # virtual hosts for the specified hostnames, allowing CustomHTTPRoutes to handle
  # requests without requiring a base HTTPRoute to be configured separately.
  #
  # This is useful when you want CustomHTTPRoutes to be the primary routing
  # mechanism for certain hostnames, without needing to create HTTPRoute resources.

  #   # hostnames lists the domains that should have catch-all routes generated
